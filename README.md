# HouseFind

 I decided to design a simple web scraper that can guide the user for some information about Housing options in Bay-Area California. Since in bay area student have difficulties to find safe and trustworthy links for housing, I was passionate to introduce some of of those affordable  and trustworthy list by scraping through the web pages..............


## Installation

  1.used the bundle gem to create the ruby gems for my project.
  2.created the Git repository and used its links for  meta data in gem-spec files.
  3.updated the ruby version and installed all updated bundle and gems
  4.all required dependencies have been added to the gem-spec file
  5.installed the atom text editor for writing  code's project
  6.Installed the License gem
  7.initiated the git repo and  push changes on the project to the git Repo

## Usage
 this web scraper app is for getting some data from web regarding the available rental-student housing.
 The User can run the program by running `house_find` via terminal and the code ask for prefer  input and user should put choices by typing integer or exit to terminate the app.
 the choices will either show the complete detail of the housing options with all information; such as Provider, price_range, location, and the url to guide the user. Or it just shows the specified details.


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
